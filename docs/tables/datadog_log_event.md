# Table: datadog_log_event

This table lists events from a Datadog logs collection.

**Important notes:**

- By default, this table lists events for the last 15 minutes.
- You can specify `timestamp` in a `where` clause in order to query logs for a time period of your choice.
- You can also use `query` in a `where` clause to search for logs matching a specific criterion. Refer [Log Search Syntax](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/explorer/search_syntax/)
